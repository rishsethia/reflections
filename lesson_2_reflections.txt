What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
A hidden git folder is created to keep tracks of commit and all.
In an initialised git repository there is no commit whatsoever and there is nothing in the staging area also.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use git diff to compare staging area to the working directory files and git diff â€”staged to view difference between staging area and the commits . So you can check whether you have made one logical change or not.
